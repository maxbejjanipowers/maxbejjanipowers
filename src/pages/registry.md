We greatly appreciate the time and expense required to attend our wedding, so please do not feel obligated to provide a gift. Your presence (or well-wishes) are more than enough. Our apartment is also tiny and full enough that we can't fit anything else. Nor do we wish to replace what we currently have. Moreover, we’re not yet in the stage of our lives where we can afford a house in West LA. But if you wish to contribute, we would be grateful for any donations made to the charities below or to our honeymoon/house fund.
