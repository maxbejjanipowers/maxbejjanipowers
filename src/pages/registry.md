We greatly appreciate the time and expense required to attend our wedding, so please do not feel obligated to provide a gift. Your presence (or well-wishes) are more than enough. Our apartment is also tiny and full enough that we can't fit anything else. Nor do we wish to replace what we currently have. Moreover, weâ€™re not yet in the stage of our lives where we can afford a house in West LA. But if you wish to contribute, we would be grateful for any donations made to the charities below or to our honeymoon/house fund.
