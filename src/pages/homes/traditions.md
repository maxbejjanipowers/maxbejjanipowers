We plan to have Lebanese and Mexican traditions at our wedding. Read more to understand what they entail.

## Traditions

### Zaffe

<a href="https://www.the961.com/lebanese-zaffe-bands-to-take-your-events-to-next-level/" target="_blank">Zaffe</a> typically consists of a band of musicians dressed in folkloric Arab costumes who usher in the entrance of the bride and groom at the reception with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dabke" target="_blank">_dabke_</a> (a kind of circle + line dance), drums, and dancing. We will have a zaffe to honor Christina’s parents’ Lebanese heritage.

### Mariachi

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariachi" target="_blank">Mariachi</a> typically consists of a band of musicians dressed in folkloric Mexican costumes who play regional music and sing about love, death, heroes, and more. We will have mariachi to honor Mark’s mom’s Mexican heritage.
