We have the Ceremony space booked until 6:00 p.m., so afterwards, we will be taking photos with immediate family and the wedding party.",

          "While immediate family and the wedding party will take photos until 6:00 p.m., everyone else is expected to attend cocktail hour on the patio. Welcome champagne will be served, as will our appetizers. Our mariachi band will play to entertain guests. We also plan to open our photobooth at this hour so that anyone who did not get photos with us earlier can do so once we move from the Ceremony space. At around 6:45 p.m., we will usher everyone indoors to their tables, where bread and butter as well as the first salad course will be served.",

          "The wedding party will enter the reception with the zaffe around 7:00 p.m. We will dance with the zaffe and then proceed with our first dance afterwards. After the salad course, everyone will have their entree course. At this time, we will give a speech and ask the folks giving speeches to do so as well. We will then proceed with our mother/son, father/daughter, and perhaps a mother/daughter dance to open the dance floor.",

We will have snack and/or other meal stations for folks who get hungry later and likely cut the cake around 10:30 pm, offering fruit as a healthy alternative for those who may not want cake. The photobooth will still be open, as will our dance floor. So, let's have some fun.",
